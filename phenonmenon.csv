Printed line is thinner than desired.
Excess filament is squished upwards at the edges of the current printing line creating a rough surface and wavy patterns.
Filament is getting torn off the bed when the next neighbouring line is printed.
Finished prints are hard to remove from the print bed.
"When looking at the bottom of your printed object, you can clearly make out individual lines with a noticeable gap between each line."
"During printing the first layer, the individual lines are not touching each other."
There’s small gaps where the lines of the infill are not touching the outlines of the wall.
"The shape of the extruding line is very round. With the proper distance, extruded line is slightly squished, pancake shaped."
Individual printed lines are barely sticking to the build plate.
Parts are warping off the build plate or become loose during the prints.
"Your print is lifting off the bed, such as warping, or returning to your printer with a birds nest."
Nozzle too close to the bed
Nozzle too far away from the print bed
"The left side of your nozzle is too close and the right side it is fine or even too high up, your bed is most likely at an angle – not level with the nozzle. Same goes for front and back and of course this can happen in both axis at the same time."

"You see debris from a previous print, dust, gunk, spots, etc"
"You see lumps, build-up or an uneven coat of your favourite bed adhesive."
You see some dents in the otherwise smooth bottom surface of a finished print.
The extruder can’t keep up with pushing filament through at this speed and you see [Under Extrusion]
Under extrusion
Over extrusion
Infill leaving gaps
walls turn out too thin
layers not thick enough (not squished)
prints not sticking / warping
rough corners
curling or sloppy overhangs
