"3D printer pillowing occurs when trying to print a solid layer over a coarse infill grid. Depending on your infill percentage and your layer height, it may take a lot of layers to fully close the top surface over infill to produce a nice, smooth surface. Figure at least 1mm of combined layers for your top layer as a rule of thumb. So, if you’re printing with a layer height of 0.2mm use at least 5 top layers to play it safe. Other ways to reduce 3D printing pillowing are:

Print colder or increase fan speeds. Better cooling improves bridging performance, and that’s basically what we’re doing when printing over infill.
Use a higher infill percentage. More infill means smaller gaps, which are easier to cover.
Another possible cause for gaps in your top layer is under-extrusion . See [Under-extrusion].",extruder,
"Adjust idler pressure spring
Another reason why filament might not get transported properly if the idler isn’t exerting enough pressure to push the filament against the feeder gear. A lot of feeders have a spring that can be tensioned to increase the idler pressure. Or this spring might be missing, broken or collapsed.",idler pressure spring,

"Brittle filament, breaking or snapping may mean stale filament. There are also some of the more brittle formulas, especially for PLA or PMMA, which might snap when passing the drive gear or is bent for example in a Bowden tube at a higher angle.

A good test for the ‘freshness’ of PLA filament is to bend it to 90 degrees (at room temperature ~20°C) with your fingers. If it snaps, it is stale. Pull 10-15 meters off the reel and try again. You might be lucky - it may only be the top layers that have gone stale.

Calibrate your extruder and reduce your material flow. Especially when switching to smaller nozzle sizes your extrusion settings need to be spot on. The smaller diameter holes are way less forgiving as we’re facing higher pressure trying to extrude through a smaller hole to begin with. Too much pressure and the drive gear of the feeder motor is likely to start grinding instead of pushing the filament.,3D printer version,

Remove the filament from the extruder. Could be a bit tricky. Check its shape. Chances are the feeder gear has eaten away a good part of the filament and dug itself in, i.e. no filament can be transported, as there is nothing left for the gear to grip.

So, once you cleaned this feeder section of the extruder of any debris and fed fresh filament in, you’ll still have to find the cause for the blockage that was responsible for this in the first place.",extruder,
"Check feeder gear
While at it, check that the teeth of the feeder gear haven’t worn. A lot of these gears are made from brass and won’t last forever. Teeth might even be missing entirely.

Also, the teeth could be gunked up with debris stripped from the filament during normal operation and need to be cleaned - small brass wire brush is ideal for this - but PLEASE, for your own sanity, make sure that no pieces of the brush or debris get into the HotEnd or the path leading to it.

Try printing colder to begin with. Sometimes you can get away with a cooler printing temperature for the rest of the print with the same result. Alternatively, reduce the temperature when the printer is approaching the problem area.
Print slower, giving the print more time to cool down. Consider the 15 second rule: the time for the nozzle coming back to the same point on your object should not be less than 15s.
If your slicer supports it, set a minimum time per layer to ensure proper cooling. This usually results in the slicer dynamically slowing down the print speed to ensure the minimum layer time, which, in this particular case, won’t help all that much.
Pro tip: you could add a pause to the layer change script and park the nozzle away from the object for a few seconds.
Workaround: try printing two copies of the object at the same time, the travel moves between the 2 objects will increase the layer time and allow for more cooling.",part cooling fan,
"Often, blockages occur right after the drive gear, especially when using flexible filaments. This can be common for some printers, so be sure to read up on if your printer is suitable to print flexible filaments. Modifications can also be printed for some extruders, files are available on websites like thingiverse.
Bowden tubes like to gather debris, increasing friction, causing blockages. Inspect, clean and replace as needed.
Another notorious spot is where the Bowden tube in Bowden extruders (or the PTFE liner tube in certain HotEnds) meets up with the metal bits. If the tip of the tube is frayed, dented, carbonised or cut at anything but a 90° angle, this is inviting trouble. Also make sure your tube is seated firmly as far in as possible. If the tube moves, for example during retractions, chances for a blockage increase.

"On most printers, the print bed is levelled by adjusting 3 or 4 screws under the print bed. (If your printer is equipped with a bed levelling automatic, this step might not be necessary even though it won’t hurt to do it manually at least once initially). Levelling is actually not the correct term for what we’re doing, but that’s what everybody is calling it. What we’re doing is to make sure that the gap between the nozzle tip and the bed is the same all across the bed. Hence: bed and nozzle are “level” with each other.

In order to do so:

Heat up your bed and nozzle to proper printing temperature, retract filament a bit and make sure the nozzle is clean (and no filament is oozing out during the levelling process).
Move the heated nozzle to the first corner of the bed.
Slide a piece of paper between the bed and the nozzle. Loosen or tighten the bed level for that corner screw until you notice a bit of drag when sliding the paper under it.
Continue to the next corner, position your nozzle over it, adjust the screw so you get the same amount of drag.
Do so for at least all for corners, then check the middle of the bed.
This might require multiple passes, as turning one screw usually affects the other screws as well. At the same time while we’re levelling the bed, we’re also setting the nozzle to bed distance. By using thicker or thinner paper in this process you also set the nozzle to bed distance at the same time.

Or in other words, when dealing with a warped bed do not try to level your bed at the 4 outermost corners, but pick a smaller area in the center of the build plate and try to level it as best as possible there.

"When trying to print thin walls that are not multiples of your nozzle width in thickness, there is a common problem with slicers leaving a gap inside walls, severely weakening the structural strength of your wall. It is rather straightforward issue: if you’re trying to print a wall that is 0.9mm thick with a 0.4mm nozzle, an average slicer might end up using 2 lines at 0.4mm each and leave a gap of 0.1mm, as it doesn’t know a way to close the remaining 0.1mm.

Therefore you should always strive to stick to a multiple of your nozzle width when designing thin walls to help alleviate the issue:

Thin wall options - A lot of slicers today have special thin wall options, make yourself familiar with them and see where they can take you.
Adjust line width - Adjust (not necessarily increase) line width or the amount of outlines to force your slicer to construct your wall differently.
You can try increasing your extrusion multiplier to close the gap by intentionally over-extruding.
You can also set a narrower nozzle diameter in your slicer settings than you actually have fitted. If used with care and balanced against the extrusion multiplier, this can overcome some situations that your favourite slicer cannot cope with.",nozzle,

A highly effective yet brutal (if done improperly) way to clean a blockage are so call cold pulls or the “atomic method”. We’ve got an article on nozzle cleaning methods here.
Another equally brutal and somewhat dangerous way is to torch your nozzle with a blowtorch (after removing it from the printer first!). The idea is to heat and melt the blockage within the nozzle. This is NOT a method rigid.ink advise for safety reasons.
With ABS you could try to soak it in an acetone bath overnight. The acetone should dissolve the blockage but will only work with materials acetone soluble have been used (rigid.ink ABS, ASA, PMMA, HIPS and Polycarbonate).
You can do the same for PLA with a bath of ethyl acetate.",first layer thickness,
