solution,Adjust nozzle to bed distance either by tightening the 3 or 4 levelling screws of your printer and using thicker paper stock for manual bed levelling or by adjusting your z-offset value when using a bed levelling sensor. Make sure you’re not pressing down on your bed when levelling it.,Solution1
solution,Adjust nozzle to bed distance either by loosening the 3 or 4 levelling screws of your printer and using thinner paper stock (receipt paper is good) for manual bed levelling or by adjusting your z-offset value when using a bed levelling sensor. Make sure you’re not pressing the bed upwards while levelling manually.,Solution2
solution,"adjusting 3 or 4 screws under the print bed: In order to do so:

(1) Heat up your bed and nozzle to proper printing temperature, retract filament a bit and make sure the nozzle is clean (and no filament is oozing out during the levelling process).
(2) Move the heated nozzle to the first corner of the bed.
(3) Slide a piece of paper between the bed and the nozzle. Loosen or tighten the bed level for that corner screw until you notice a bit of drag when sliding the paper under it.
(4) Continue to the next corner, position your nozzle over it, adjust the screw so you get the same amount of drag.
(5) Do so for at least all for corners, then check the middle of the bed.",Solution3
solution,print a very thick first layer(but do not exceed maximum layer height = 75% nozzle size. i.e. 0.3mm for a 0.4mm nozzle),Solution4
solution,try printing with a raft,Solution5
solution,pick a smaller area in the center of the build plate and try to level it as best as possible there,Solution6
solution,"Degrease your bed surface regularly according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Use either isopropyl alcohol/isopropanol in a high concentration or pure acetone. Stay away from window cleaners, dish washing liquids and soaps, especially those who are supposed to be good for your skin, as most of them will leave a residue behind that will negatively affect bed adhesion.",Solution7
solution,"Every proper slicer out there has the option to specify a different print speed for your first layer. In Cura, it is called “Initial Layer speed”. In Simplify3D it is called “First Layer Speed”. We're pretty sure your slicer has this setting as well, under some variation of those names. Usually a speed of 30mm/s or less is good for the first layer, you can increase the speed later on but experimenting is key.",Solution8
solution,Calibrate the extruder steps required to extrude the requested amount of filament.,Solution9
solution,Check your extrusion multiplier in your slicer software to ensure proper amount of filament is extruded.,Solution10
solution,Check that you selected the proper filament size (1.75mm/2.85mm/3.00mm) in your slicer.,Solution11
solution,"Ensure filament can be transported properly (i.e. filament unspools freely from the spool, no excess friction in the filament path).",Solution12
solution,Ensure nozzle isn’t blocked or partially blocked. This is a very common cause of under-extrusion or uneven extrusion. See [Clogged Nozzle].,Solution13
solution,Almost all slicers out there will allow you to set a different print temperature for your first/initial layer. Use this feature to adjust bed adhesion without it affecting the rest of your print.,Solution14
solution,"Look up the glass transition temperature of the material you’re printing. Ensure your bed temperature is at least around 10°C below the glass transition temperature. If your bed is far below the glass transition temperature and you’re having trouble with your print not sticking, increase your bed temperature in 5°C increments until the issue is resolved (staying below the GT temp)",Solution15
solution,Disable the part cooling fan for the first layer.,Solution16
