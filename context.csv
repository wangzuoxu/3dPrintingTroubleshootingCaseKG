Printed line is thinner than desired.,Context1
Excess filament is squished upwards at the edges of the current printing line creating a rough surface and wavy patterns.,Context2
Filament is getting torn off the bed when the next neighbouring line is printed.,Context3
Finished prints are hard to remove from the print bed.,Context4
"When looking at the bottom of your printed object, you can clearly make out individual lines with a noticeable gap between each line.",Context5
"During printing the first layer, the individual lines are not touching each other.",Context6
There’s small gaps where the lines of the infill are not touching the outlines of the wall.,Context7
"The shape of the extruding line is very round. With the proper distance, extruded line is slightly squished, pancake shaped.",Context8
Individual printed lines are barely sticking to the build plate.,Context9
Parts are warping off the build plate or become loose during the prints.,Context10
"Your print is lifting off the bed, such as warping, or returning to your printer with a birds nest.",Context11
Nozzle too close to the bed,Context12
Nozzle too far away from the print bed,Context13
"The left side of your nozzle is too close and the right side it is fine or even too high up, your bed is most likely at an angle – not level with the nozzle. Same goes for front and back and of course this can happen in both axis at the same time.",Context14
"You see debris from a previous print, dust, gunk, spots, etc",Context15
"You see lumps, build-up or an uneven coat of your favourite bed adhesive.",Context16
You see some dents in the otherwise smooth bottom surface of a finished print.,Context17
The extruder can’t keep up with pushing filament through at this speed and you see [Under Extrusion],Context18
Under extrusion,Context19
Over extrusion,Context20
Infill leaving gaps,Context21
walls turn out too thin,Context22

rough corners,Context25
curling or sloppy overhangs,Context26
Elephant foot,Context27
curling close to the bed,Context28
your part cooling fan is spinning while printing the first layer you need to look at your fan settings.,Context29
