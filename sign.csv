Printed line is thinner than desired.,Sign1
Excess filament is squished upwards at the edges of the current printing line creating a rough surface and wavy patterns.,Sign2
Filament is getting torn off the bed when the next neighbouring line is printed.,Sign3
Finished prints are hard to remove from the print bed.,Sign4
"When looking at the bottom of your printed object, you can clearly make out individual lines with a noticeable gap between each line.",Sign5
"During printing the first layer, the individual lines are not touching each other.",Sign6
There’s small gaps where the lines of the infill are not touching the outlines of the wall.,Sign7
"The shape of the extruding line is very round. With the proper distance, extruded line is slightly squished, pancake shaped.",Sign8
Individual printed lines are barely sticking to the build plate.,Sign9
Parts are warping off the build plate or become loose during the prints.,Sign10
"Your print is lifting off the bed, such as warping, or returning to your printer with a birds nest.",Sign11
Nozzle too close to the bed,Sign12
Nozzle too far away from the print bed,Sign13
"The left side of your nozzle is too close and the right side it is fine or even too high up, your bed is most likely at an angle – not level with the nozzle. Same goes for front and back and of course this can happen in both axis at the same time.",Sign14

"You see debris from a previous print, dust, gunk, spots, etc",Sign26
"You see lumps, build-up or an uneven coat of your favourite bed adhesive.",Sign27
You see some dents in the otherwise smooth bottom surface of a finished print.,Sign28
The extruder can’t keep up with pushing filament through at this speed and you see [Under Extrusion],Sign29
Under extrusion,Sign30
Over extrusion,Sign31
Infill leaving gaps,Sign32
walls turn out too thin,Sign33
layers not thick enough (not squished),Sign34
prints not sticking / warping,Sign35
rough corners,Sign36
curling or sloppy overhangs,Sign37
prints not sticking / warping,Sign38
Elephant foot,Sign39
curling close to the bed,Sign40
your part cooling fan is spinning while printing the first layer you need to look at your fan settings.,Sign41
