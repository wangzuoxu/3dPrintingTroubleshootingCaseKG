First Layer Issues,"PLA likes to be squished more into the bed than other filament types to provide good adhesion.
PETG usually prints better with a higher nozzle to bed distance to avoid the nozzle picking up filament that might drip on your print later during the print. Also, the extra distance helps prevent excessive adhesion issue that for example might occur when printing on glass or PEI beds.
TPU and Flexible PLA will also adhere stronger than you might like if printed too close to a PEI or specialist bed surface (such as BuildTak)."
Prints Sticking Too Much,"PETG is known to be strong enough to rip chunks out of glass plates when cooling down after a print or bonding permanently to a PEI bed.
Flexible filaments have a habit of sticking way to well to certain bed surfaces. Add Kapton tape for flexible filaments. Peel the Kapton tape from the bed, then the tape from the bottom of your print to minimize the risk of damaging your print when trying to pry it off your bed."
Stringing and Oozing,"Flexible filament usually needs longer retractions as it stretches while being pulled backwards. However retractions on flexibles is even trickier than actually printing flexible filaments, so you might be forced to go with shorter or even no retraction at all in order to be able to print it in the first place.
ASA, like ABS, reacts strongly to sudden temperature changes. If you all of a sudden blast it with full part cooling fans, it might crack."
Overheating,"PLA is often printed with 100% cooling fans anyway so if you're seeing overheating, it suggests your printing temperature is too high. We always suggest starting at the lower end of the suggested temperature range and work your way up.
ASA does not like fans or draughts. Part cooling fans should not reach more than 10-20% with ASA. A warm ambient temperature is best but that doesn't mean print at the hottest temperature within the range. Try reducing your printing temperature if you experience over heating with ASA.
For other filaments that you're already printing at 100% part cooling fans, try adding extra external fans next to the printer to provide further cooling."
Walls Caving In,"PLA is often printed with 100% cooling fans anyway so if you're seeing caving in, it suggests your printing temperature is too high. We always suggest starting at the lower end of the suggested temperature range and work your way up. High quality, pure PLA will be best printed at or below 200°C.
ASA does not like fans or draughts. Part cooling fans should not reach more than 10-20% with ASA. A warm ambient temperature is best but that doesn't mean print at the hottest temperature within the range. Try reducing your printing temperature if you experience caving in with ASA.
For other filaments that you're already printing at 100% part cooling fans, try adding extra external fans next to the printer to provide further cooling, if reducing the print temperature is not effective enough."
Curling and Rough Corners,ASA does not like fans or draughts. Part cooling fans should not reach more than 10-20% with ASA. A warm ambient temperature is best but that doesn't mean print at the hottest temperature within the range. Try reducing your printing temperature if you experience curling/rough corners with ASA.
Cracking or Layer Separation,"ABS is highly susceptible to 3D printer layer separation due to cold air hitting the print before it has cooled down fully. We suggest no fans for rigid.ink ABS. rigid.ink ABS prints best in a fully enclosed and even heated chamber.
ASA can also be very susceptible to 3D printer layer separation. rigid.ink ASA does prefer a warm ambient temperature so a heated, closed chamber is best. However, it can be used with an unheated enclosure or even on an open printer with a simple draught shield (it’s the draughts that matter most!). This is why we suggest using minimal fans around 5-20% fan speed.
PLA may suffer from cracking and layer separation problems if you’re printing too cool. Try increasing the printing temperature in 5°C increments, until you get successful layer adhesion."
Burnt Stuff Dripping On Your Print,"PETG especially tends to gather on your nozzle, accumulate during the print and eventually drip. This (and its sometimes-excessive adhesion to certain build plate surfaces) is why we recommend not squishing your first layer when printing with PETG.
When printing Wood particle filled filament the polymer binding agents (cellulose resin and/or viscose blended with PLA) tends to drip from your HotEnd in a honey like consistency when printing to hot. Or after it sat in a heated nozzle for a while. Print colder and at a constant speed."
