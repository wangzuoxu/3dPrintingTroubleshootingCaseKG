Warping,Usually it starts in the corners and can progress if the print isn't stopped. The print will start to lift and appear to peel away from the bed.,"Warping occurs when the physical forces that come into play as a material is cooling down exceeds the adhesion strength of the printed object holding it onto your build plate. Warping is increased, the higher the temperature difference is within the printed object, and/or the higher the difference is between printed temperature and room temperature."
Inconsistent Extrusion: How To Fix Under Extrusion,"The signs are easy to spot: you end up with weak prints that crumble, crack or tear under even slight stress, you have visible gaps in your objects, walls start becoming see through because solid areas show spongy patches instead.",Under extrusion occurs when your printer is unable to supply the correct amount of material needed to correctly print a layer.
Inconsistent Extrusion: How To fix Over Extrusion,"Too much plastic is coming out of the nozzle. You will be able to see this on your print (if not when coming out of the nozzle) the lines will be thick, uneven and ‘blobby’ in areas.",Over extrusion is when the printer is extruding too much plastic through the nozzle. This can happen because of a few settings being slightly off but read below for how to fix it.
Extruder Is Grinding Filament,"The picture on the left shows a section of filament after it was manually pulled out of the extruder. You can see the dent where the drive gear dug in deep into the filament, making further transport of this filament impossible. It had to be removed manually with a bit of force.","This usually happens when the pressure inside the HotEnd gets too high or if there is anything blocking filament transport. 3D printer filament grinding can be caused by a number of different things, read our 'How to fix:' section to learn more."
Extruder Is Crushing Filament,"A tell-tale sign for filament being crushed is that is appears deformed. This piece of filament in the picture for example, is clearly deformed and is no longer round. It was crushed between the idler and feeder drive gear.","This problem is related to [Extruder is grinding filament] and is usually a precursor of that. This happens a lot when:

The feeder gear idler pressure is way too high, deforming the filament while it passes through the feeder.
The same part of filament is getting retracted, pushed forward, retracted multiple times. Printing something with a lot of retractions in short order will wreak havoc on the filament, especially if the feeder idler pressure is squeezing the filament a bit too tight."
Clogged Nozzle,"Most full blockages will give you an early warning sign by under extruding first, signalling a partial blockage. Sometimes a particle or containment within the filament (guaranteed not to happen with rigid.ink) will lodge in an otherwise clear nozzle causing it to block immediately.","Clogged nozzles can happen due to various reasons. Here’s a list of the most common reasons we’ve experienced:

Either the filament was printed too hot or had the nozzle distance was too close to the bed.
The printer was left sitting idle with a heated nozzle.
Dust & dirt might have been pulled into the now clogged extruder HotEnd.
The filament was contaminated (some cheap stuff is full of things that shouldn’t be in there).
The nozzle has not been regularly cleaned and build up has occurred.
The filament you were previously printing, printed at a very different temperature to the current filament.
Filament material and/or brand is being switched regularly without cleaning in between.
Wood filament was being printed (we’ve had some of the best clogs ever when printing with wood filament!)."
Stringing and Oozing,"The signs on stringing and oozing are usually quite obvious, as seen on the print in the image. There will be bits of filament fraying off your print and some areas of the print will have excess filament where it has oozed. You may also be able to see the filament is very runny coming out of the nozzle.",As filament stringing and oozing is often caused by incorrect printing temperature and retraction settings. Printing too hot will cause the filament to be too runny and also mean it will take longer to cool once printed allowing for stringing and oozing. Not having enough retraction can also mean more filament is being extruded and causes these issues.
Overheating,Your print has the correct general shape but has deformed where it has overheated. This can be at the start of your print or part way through. See the tip of the (supposed) spike in the image that has become molten because of overheating.,"Overheating is exactly what it says, the filament has become too hot and isn’t cooling enough. The main cause of overheating is insufficient cooling."
Elephants Foot,"You’ll see a flared out 1st layer, making our parts too big. Followed by a concave indentation of the next few lines before things straighten out as the heat radiating from the heat bed diminishes. As shown in the image.","The heat from the bed tends to be too much for the filament causing it to flare out. As the print continues higher and the heat from the bed diminishes the print, prints normally."
Walls Caving In,Part of the wall of a print has caved in and then returned to the correct structure after a few layers.,The weight of the subsequent layers crushes the lower layers that never had a chance to fully harden.
Curling and Rough Corners,Rough corners are basically corners that are curling upwards. They are very hard to miss as they only appear to affect the corners of your print. The beams corners in the image is the classic test case to demonstrate 3D print curling.,Curling as well as rough corners are another symptom of printing too hot – or insufficient cooling. Printer curling happens a lot when printing overhangs – or in corners.
Cracking or Layer Separation,"On a first glance, it can be tricky to differentiate between cracking and temporary under-extrusion as both leave gaps in layers or leave the print looking like it’s missing layers. Best way to tell them apart is: cracked layers are clean cuts and might show a bit of an upwards bend or warp, while under-extrusion tends to leave a spongy material deposition in the cracks.",Cracking occurs when 3D printing layers separate because of the forces exerted on the print when layers cool at a different rate. Warping forces exceed the layer adhesion strength and the layers simply separate.
Layers Shifting & Misaligned Layers,"As seen in the image, you can see the shift in the print and that the layers are not aligned.",Unfortunately issues like this can happen randomly and often part way through a print. The 'How to fix:' section below can also be used as a check-list before you set your print going to prevent this happening.
Layers Missing or Skipped Layers,"The print has not shifted in any way, but it appears an entire layer(s) is missing within your print.","Most likely the layer isn’t missing, but due to a mechanical issue with your Z-axis, there was an uneven step when moving up to the next layer. Can easily be mistaken for [Under Extrusion] or [Cracking or Layer Separation]."
Weak or Under-Extruded Infill,Your 3D printing infill looks weak or under-extruded (spongy in appearance).,"Often due to settings being slightly out, while you may get away with poor infill not affecting the external appearance of your 3D print quality, it provides almost no stability to the print."
Deformed Infill,The pattern of infill appears deformed rather than printing evenly.,There may be some settings that aren’t quite correct which is causing deformed infill. If the structure chosen is not suitable extra support may be needed.
Insufficient Retractions,"Similar to stringing and oozing, you will see excess filament on your print in areas where there is not meant to be filament.","There’s a limit how far you can push your extruder to do retractions. If, after maxing out your retraction settings as described in the [Stringing and 3D printer oozing] chapter, you’re still seeing signs of insufficient retractions there are some other things to consider, see ‘How to fix:’ below."
Blobs and 3D Printing Zits,Blob and 3D printing zits are another case of excess filament on your print. There isn’t usually a large amount of stringing and it only happens on some areas of the print.,"Often caused by retraction settings, additional filament blobs out and onto the print."
Infill Poking Through Outline,"At a first glance, the blobs in the picture shown might look just like your standard blobs from improper extrusion. On a second look, you’ll notice that the blobs in this picture actually match with where the infill pattern meets up with the outside wall. This shows you’ve got infill poking through the outlines.",The blobs are usually a result of the retraction that is occurring at those points. You may also have to look at your outline settings.
Scratches on Top Layers,There is a visible scratch on the top layer that is not a line from oozing filament.,"The long scratch visible on the top layer in the picture shown was caused by the nozzle dragging across the top layer when moving across to go on printing the rest of the frame around it. Most likely, the 3D printing surface of that layer is over-extruded (or slightly warped or pillowed) and that’s why the nozzle scratched it in the move."
Gaps & Holes,"Probably one of the most obvious problems to spot in a print. There will be visible gaps and holes in your print, like in the image shown.","Unfortunately, there can be many reasons for the gaps and we have broken them down in the ‘How to fix:’ section below."
Small Parts & Features Not Printing,You’re unable to see the detail in detailed sections of your print. Smaller parts are deformed and not printing correctly compared to the rest of the print.,"If you don’t have the right set up for the part you’re trying to print, your printer will struggle to achieve small parts and features. When trying to print with a 0.4mm nozzle it is hard to draw a 0.1mm line. Slicers usually give up at one point or another and won’t even try to print features that are way smaller than your nozzle width (if placed on the XY plane)."
Lines On The Side Of Your Prints,"You will be able to see off lines on the side of your print. The lines may be vertical and possibly even wobbly, like in the image shown.","Besides trying to print way too fast (incl. too high acceleration and jerk settings), the root cause of these 3D printing errors are often of mechanical nature."
Temperature Variations,Variations between layers will be visible. You can diagnose this from layers with uneven extrusion: [Under Extrusion] and [Over Extrusion].,These variations in layers are often a result of temperature fluctuations. Best would be to try a few tethered prints while running a monitoring software. For example the free and open source Pronterface to graph the exact temperature at the nozzle during printing.
Vibrations and 3D Printing Ringing,"Lines are appearing on your print as if they are a shadow of some detail on the print, see the image used.",More commonly vibrations and 3D printing ringing are caused by mechanical issues but there are a couple of settings that could also cause this issue.
Circles Are Not Round,"Pretty obvious most of the time, but sometimes they can be only slightly off so be sure to look out for them.","Oval circles instead of round ones are usually due to a mechanical problem. On tiny circles only a few mm in diameter, blobs usually along the Z-scar, might cause the circle to look oval instead.

Occasionally it can be down to having differing steps/mm values entered for the X and Y axes. This can happen (rarely) by EEPROM value corruption, but usually comes down to a user-induced fault."
Leaning Prints,Usually a very slight but constant or proportionally increasing deviation along one axis. In contrast: a layer shift is a sudden singular(ish) occurrence at a much bigger scale.,Prints that are leaning to one side are usually caused by mechanical issues.
Poor Surface Quality Above Supports,"We’re looking at the bottom of an object that was printed above a slicer generated support structure. It looks rough, even a bit droopy.",The slicer generated support structure is not suitable for your set up and some adjustments are needed.
Failing Supports,Usually you’re using supports because they are needed for your print. If your supports fail it will be very visible as your print will not be complete.,"Support pillars, especially when setup using a low support density are not the most stable things and will be in increasing danger of toppling over the taller they get."
Poor Bridging,Saggy lines in the picture show poor bridging performance.,"If you don’t have the correct settings for the bridging needed, then you will experience saggy lines and poor bridging."
Stringy & Droopy Overhangs,"Your overhangs should appear as smooth as the rest of your print if set up correctly. If they are looking more like the image shown, you’re experiencing droopy overhangs.","Stringy prints or droopy overhangs are usually a result of printing too hot or insufficient cooling. In a way overhangs are even worse to print than bridges. As bridges have a supported start and landing zone. The overhang doesn’t, it just clings to the neighbouring line."
Molten/Deformed Prints,"All of your print appears to be ‘melted’, droopy and deformed. In 3D printing, you want for a smooth consistent print, not like the example in the image.","If your prints are suffering from these deformities, chances are you’re printing too hot or do not have sufficient cooling fans.
"
Burnt Stuff Dripping On Your Print,"See the drop of brown molten ooze on that picture there? It not only looks poor, especially if it lands on one of the outer surfaces, it can ruin your print when your HotEnd hits it on the next pass. We’ve had multiple cases where a drop like this damaged some of our (cheaper) printers. So, let’s try and avoid this.","Most commonly due to build up on the nozzle of a leaking HotEnd, but can be worse with certain materials."
Clicking Motors,"If you hear a motor clicking it’s a sure sign that something is wrong. If it is the extruder motor that is clicking, check this chapter: [Filament not extruding properly]. For any other stepper clicking, continue here.","Usually this is a hardware issue. Clicking means the motor is stalled, so that it is just twitching and not rotating. This will eventually ruin your print, leading to layer shifts or leaning prints."
Other Blockages,"Unfortunately, the nozzle isn’t the only place where clogs might occur. If no filament is coming out of the nozzle anymore the actual blockage might not be in the nozzle itself. You’ll have to check the whole filament path, starting from the feeder to the nozzle.","Often, blockages occur right after the drive gear, especially when using flexible filaments. This can be common for some printers, so be sure to read up on if your printer is suitable to print flexible filaments. Modifications can also be printed for some extruders, files are available on websites like thingiverse."
