condition,solution
Nozzle too close to the bed,Adjust nozzle to bed distance either by tightening the 3 or 4 levelling screws of your printer and using thicker paper stock for manual bed levelling or by adjusting your z-offset value when using a bed levelling sensor. Make sure you’re not pressing down on your bed when levelling it.
Nozzle too far away from the print bed,Adjust nozzle to bed distance either by loosening the 3 or 4 levelling screws of your printer and using thinner paper stock (receipt paper is good) for manual bed levelling or by adjusting your z-offset value when using a bed levelling sensor. Make sure you’re not pressing the bed upwards while levelling manually.
Print Not Sticking,See [Print Not Sticking To Bed].
Platform not level,"On most printers, the print bed is levelled by adjusting 3 or 4 screws under the print bed. (If your printer is equipped with a bed levelling automatic, this step might not be necessary even though it won’t hurt to do it manually at least once initially). Levelling is actually not the correct term for what we’re doing, but that’s what everybody is calling it. What we’re doing is to make sure that the gap between the nozzle tip and the bed is the same all across the bed. Hence: bed and nozzle are “level” with each other.

In order to do so:

Heat up your bed and nozzle to proper printing temperature, retract filament a bit and make sure the nozzle is clean (and no filament is oozing out during the levelling process).
Move the heated nozzle to the first corner of the bed.
Slide a piece of paper between the bed and the nozzle. Loosen or tighten the bed level for that corner screw until you notice a bit of drag when sliding the paper under it.
Continue to the next corner, position your nozzle over it, adjust the screw so you get the same amount of drag.
Do so for at least all for corners, then check the middle of the bed.
This might require multiple passes, as turning one screw usually affects the other screws as well. At the same time while we’re levelling the bed, we’re also setting the nozzle to bed distance. By using thicker or thinner paper in this process you also set the nozzle to bed distance at the same time. The receipt paper from your last grocery store purchase for example sets the nozzle to bed distance that usually works quite well for PLA while thicker paper might work better for PETG."
Platform is warped,"Usually you can work around warped build plates by printing a very thick first layer (but do not exceed maximum layer height = 75% nozzle size. i.e. 0.3mm for a 0.4mm nozzle). If all else fails, try printing with a raft. Also, with a warped build plate, leveling your bed in such a way that your nozzle to bed distance fits in a smaller area will allow you to work reliably with at least part of a warped build plate.

Or in other words, when dealing with a warped bed do not try to level your bed at the 4 outermost corners, but pick a smaller area in the center of the build plate and try to level it as best as possible there. Idea behind this is, most of the prints seldom require the whole bed, so make a smaller area work well."
Clean your bed,"Degrease your bed surface regularly according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Use either isopropyl alcohol/isopropanol in a high concentration or pure acetone. Stay away from window cleaners, dish washing liquids and soaps, especially those who are supposed to be good for your skin, as most of them will leave a residue behind that will negatively affect bed adhesion."
First layer too fast,"Every proper slicer out there has the option to specify a different print speed for your first layer. In Cura, it is called “Initial Layer speed”. In Simplify3D it is called “First Layer Speed”. We're pretty sure your slicer has this setting as well, under some variation of those names. Usually a speed of 30mm/s or less is good for the first layer, you can increase the speed later on but experimenting is key."
Check extrusion settings to ensure proper amount of plastic is extruded,"Calibrate the extruder steps required to extrude the requested amount of filament.
Check your extrusion multiplier in your slicer software to ensure proper amount of filament is extruded.
Check that you selected the proper filament size (1.75mm/2.85mm/3.00mm) in your slicer.
Ensure filament can be transported properly (i.e. filament unspools freely from the spool, no excess friction in the filament path).
Ensure nozzle isn’t blocked or partially blocked. This is a very common cause of under-extrusion or uneven extrusion. See [Clogged Nozzle]."
Print temperature for first layer,"Almost all slicers out there will allow you to set a different print temperature for your first/initial layer. Use this feature to adjust bed adhesion without it affecting the rest of your print.

Printing colder will decrease adhesion. Printing hotter (to a point) will increase adhesion. But do not exceed the maximum recommended print temperature for the filament you’re using to avoid the filament deteriorating in the HotEnd, which might lead to clogs. Print as cool as possible while maintaining proper adhesion is best."
Bed temperature first layer,"Look up the glass transition temperature of the material you’re printing. Ensure your bed temperature is at least around 10°C below the glass transition temperature. If your bed is far below the glass transition temperature and you’re having trouble with your print not sticking, increase your bed temperature in 5°C increments until the issue is resolved (staying below the GT temp).

For rigid.ink PLA for example, do not exceed 50°C. More is not better. If your bed is too hot, you will increase warping forces and the risk of prints warping or even detaching during the print is increased instead of prevented – and you’ll invite other problems later on in the prints, like Elephant foot or caved in walls."
Part cooling fan settings,Disable the part cooling fan for the first layer.
Use build plate adhesion helpers,"When applying helpers to your bed, make sure you apply a thin and even coat. We do not want mountains of glue stick, nor thick patches of hairspray. Nice, thin and even is key. When applying tapes, do not let the edges overlap, apply the tape strips so they sit flush against the previous strip. And do make sure you’re not trapping air bubbles when applying your tape or surface.

There’s nothing worse than an uneven surface because of bubbles and with the cost of some of these surfaces, having to toss a brand-new surface because of bubbles underneath it can be quite annoying.

Please Note: Not all surfaces and coatings suit all materials so check with the manufacturer before making your choice.
"
Bed Temperature,"Check you're not printing too close to the glass transition temperature of the material (find rigid.ink GT temps in the datasheet download, in the settings tab on product pages).

Reduce the bed temperature in increments of 5°C until your print adheres correctly.

You may also want to consider printing the first layer faster and/or colder."
Bed adhesion,Add a very thin layer of talcum or baby powder onto your bed. Ensure you remove any excess powder.
Release agent,"Use a thin, even layer of PVA glue stick or vinyl-based hairspray coating on the build plate to act as “release agent”."
Extrusion multiplier,Slightly decrease the extrusion multiplier and perform a small test after each change until the adhesion is correct.
Freezing,Put the affixed print and bed into a freezer for a few hours. The print should then pop off with some light tapping once cool enough.
Under extrusion in general,"Make sure your filament can unspool freely from the reel.
Check the filament path for any blockages or areas of strong friction.
Verify the filament diameter is consistent. Especially very cheap filaments suffer from fluctuations in filament diameter. Too thin and there isn’t enough filament fed into the HotEnd, too thick and there might be too much friction to push through the extruder and the related filament path.
Check the extrusion settings in your slicer, namely filament diameter, extrusion multiplier.
Check proper print temperature and speed. Try printing hotter and slower.
Also see [filament not feeding properly].
If you printer is constantly under extruding, as in: it is not pushing enough plastic, it is best to recalibrate the steps/mm value of your extruder to ensure your extruder delivers the proper amount of filament requested. Once the steps per mm are set correctly, the next step to a proper calibration is to set your extrusion multiplier (also called feed rate) properly. Both steps/mm as well as extrusion multipliers are filament dependent and might even change over time.

Or it could simply be a matter of you having changed the extrusion multiplier for a recent print and forgot to reset it in your slicer. Also, very often the root cause for constant under-extrusion is a partially clogged nozzle. Cleaning out your nozzle would be a good start. Also check [filament not feeding properly]."
3D printer not extruding mid-print,"You’ve come back to find your 3D printer not printing anymore. This along with coming back to find a ‘birdsnest’ are the two most cliche versions of failed 3D prints. For some reason or another, your 3D printer stops extruding mid print:

Filament has stripped or is blocked in the extruder. See [Clogged Nozzle]
Filament is kinked, snapped or ran out. The filament has twisted or you got a knot on the reel. See our article How to untangle a tangled spool
Filament diameter isn’t consistent. Especially very cheap filaments suffer from fluctuations in filament diameter. Too thin and there isn’t enough filament fed into the HotEnd, to thick and there might be too much friction to push it in through the extruder and the related filament path.
You’re trying to print a part with too aggressive retraction 3D printing settings or excessive amount of retractions in a short period of time. Check your 3D printer retraction settings and lower total amount of retractions occurring and/or reduce retraction distance. Sometimes loosening the feeder gear idler pressure onto the filament can help.
Overheated stepper drivers. A lot of tinkerers like to increase the Vref of their stepper drivers, often needlessly. This could lead to overheated steppers. Also, when printing high temperature filaments in an enclosed or heated build chamber steppers tend to get considerably hotter.
Nozzle clogged mid print. This again can have a lot of different causes. See [Clogged Nozzle]
If it happens very early in the print, it might be too much back pressure because the nozzle is too close to the bed. See [Nozzle too close].
In general: Try printing hotter or slower. But do not exceed the maximum print temperature of the filament, as it might start to deteriorate in your nozzle and clog. Very common error is to boil rigid ink PLA by exceeding the maximum print temperature.
Check for warping. Warped areas are closer to the nozzle increasing back pressure. See [Warping]
Monitor nozzle temperature while printing, check for high drops in print temperature.
Keep your nozzle clean, especially after switching between different filament types.
When using particle filled filaments, consider using a bigger nozzle.
Flexible filament got stuck. Flexible filaments are difficult to print with most extruders out there, as they tend to escape the intended filament path and simply get stuck. Try printing way slower, try printing hotter (within the recommended range) and maybe even consider upgrading to a different extruder design specialised in printing flexible filaments.
Also see [Filament not feeding properly]."
Under extrusion at the beginning of a print,"Under extrusion at the beginning of a print is common and to a point to be considered normal. It can take a bit to get the flow of filament going, this is where using a skirt if no brim is required comes in handy.

Consider using a skirt as this will show how consistently the material is being laid down before you waste filament on the printed object itself.
Modify your start code in your slicer to add some extra priming. While you’re checking the codes, make sure you don’t have an excessive retract in your end code.
Often, not extruding properly at the beginning of a print is a result of the nozzle being too close to the bed or issues mentioned in the sections above.
Check print temperature, you might be printing too cold.
Also see [filament not feeding properly]."
Under extrusion after retraction,"During a 3D printing retraction, especially with very aggressive retract settings, there could be not enough filament in the nozzle to properly start the print again at the end of the travel move.

To fix:

Lower your retraction length.
Give it a bit extra restart distance to prime the nozzle after the retraction.
A series of very fast retracts can chew up a filament so that the feeder gear can slip on the damaged filament once you start extruding again.

To fix:

Slow down the retraction speed.
Check that the feeder pinch wheel tension is correct."
Extruder motor is clicking,"Deformed filament
Remove the filament from the extruder and check how it looks. Is it deformed, as in no longer round but crushed so that its diameter is now wider than it should be? If so you might want to try to decrease the idler pressure on your feeder gear.

Conversely, if the filament is not crushed, but just has a gouge taken out of it where the hob gear has repeatedly slipped, increasing the idler pressure may restore correct filament feeding. Just don’t overdo it or the problems listed above will likely happen."
Extruder motor is clicking,"Reduce strain
This problem is made worse when you’re trying to print something that requires a lot of retractions in a short amount of time. Try to reduce the amount of retractions or set your retracts to be less aggressive."
Extruder motor is clicking,"Reduce friction
Check your filament path for excess friction."
Extruder motor is clicking,"Worn PTFE liner
A lot of HotEnds, even in direct extruders, include a PTFE liner, i.e. a short piece of Bowden tube somewhere between nozzle and heat break. In most Bowden style extruders, the tube extends all the way from the extruder down into the HotEnd. If this inner tube is worn or degraded (happens when printing too hot, usually above 260°C) the friction increases and might be too much for the extruder stepper motor to overcome."
Extruder motor is clicking,"Check PTFE liner gap
If the HotEnd uses a PTFE liner and it is frayed or has been cut at an angle. Any gap there will lead to clogs sooner or later as the melted filament will leak out around the outside of the liner causing the liner’s inner diameter to deform and reduce.

When using an Ultimaker: check the PTFE coupler in your HotEnd. It is considered consumable and will need replacement on a regular basis."
Extruder motor is clicking,"Nozzle clogged
Your nozzle or HotEnd is clogged. This could be any of the benign reasons like printing too cold, or too hot, or too fast, using too much retraction or nozzle to close to the bed, etc. But there are also some mechanical things to look into, especially if the problem reappears after you cleaned it."
Extruder motor is clicking,"To note:
If your HotEnd wasn’t assembled properly, a common point of failure here is if the nozzle is tightened against the heater block instead of tightening it against the heat break."
Extruder motor is clicking,"Pro tip:
Increase the Vref of the extruder stepper, giving it a little more power to maybe push a bit stronger without skipping. But do keep an eye on the motor and driver temperatures if you do."
Bowden tube issues,"If you’re using a Bowden extruder, these are also common points of failure:

There’s debris in the Bowden tube.
The Bowden tube is worn in the inside and has increased friction.
The bend radius of the Bowden tube is too high. Consider a longer tube or straighten its path.
A common issue with Bowden style extruders is when the tubing isn’t pushed all the way into the HotEnd. Or the end of the tube is frayed or has been cut at an angle. Any gap there will lead to clogs sooner or later as the melted filament leaks out around the tube causing it to deform."
If the extruder isn’t clicking,"Check extruder is clear
Remove the filament from the extruder. Could be a bit tricky. Check its shape. Chances are the feeder gear has eaten away a good part of the filament and dug itself in, i.e. no filament can be transported, as there is nothing left for the gear to grip. This is usually a consequence of a blockage that happened before. So, once you cleaned this feeder section of the extruder of any debris and fed fresh filament in, you’ll still have to find the cause for the blockage that was responsible for this in the first place."
If the extruder isn’t clicking,"Adjust idler pressure spring
Another reason why filament might not get transported properly if the idler isn’t exerting enough pressure to push the filament against the feeder gear. A lot of feeders have a spring that can be tensioned to increase the idler pressure. Or this spring might be missing, broken or collapsed."
If the extruder isn’t clicking,"Check feeder gear
While at it, check that the teeth of the feeder gear haven’t worn. A lot of these gears are made from brass and won’t last forever. Teeth might even be missing entirely.

Also, the teeth could be gunked up with debris stripped from the filament during normal operation and need to be cleaned - small brass wire brush is ideal for this - but PLEASE, for your own sanity, make sure that no pieces of the brush or debris get into the HotEnd or the path leading to it. Metal particles in a HotEnd and nozzle are not something you ever want to happen."
If the extruder isn’t clicking,"Check thermister
Most firmware versions today will deactivate the extruder motor if the nozzle is not up to temperature. So, it won’t click and not feed anything either. Take a peek at your nozzle temperature, maybe your thermistor stopped working?"
Motor is wildly turning back and forth even with no filament loaded,"This could be a sign of a loose motor cable either at the board or the motor end, a broken cable or broken or loose pin in the connector. Or a failed motor. Or wrong cable configuration with leads swapped. If this happens, stop what the printer is doing immediately, let it cool down and power it off!

A broken wire on a stepper can easily destroy a driver chip by creating high voltage spikes as the stepper is connected and disconnected (the same damage can occur if you manually disconnect or reconnect a stepper motor while the printer is powered-up)."
Deformed filament or filament diameter too thick,"Use good calipers or a better yet a micrometer screw gauge to measure the diameter of the filament coming of the spool and check if it is round or has been flattened. If it is thicker than it should be or no longer perfectly round, return the spool to the manufacturer/seller for a replacement. Cheap filaments often have large fluctuations in their diameter."
"Filament not unspooling from the spool, kinked, knotted or twisted on the spool","You may be able to see the issue and untangle the knot or remove a layer or two if there is a kink. If you cannot see the issue but your spool will not unspool easily, or it is repeatedly happening, please see our article [How to untangle a tangled or knotted spool]."
Too much friction in filament path (especially common with worn or dirty Bowden tubes),"Check the filament path is clean, especially if using a Bowden tube. If your Bowden tube or another part has become worn it may need replacing."
Trying to extrude too much material for the nozzle size,Calibrate your extruder and reduce your material flow. Especially when switching to smaller nozzle sizes your extrusion settings need to be spot on. The smaller diameter holes are way less forgiving as we’re facing higher pressure trying to extrude through a smaller hole to begin with. Too much pressure and the drive gear of the feeder motor is likely to start grinding instead of pushing the filament.
Partial (or full) clog in the nozzle or HotEnd,See [Clogged Nozzle].
The nozzle being too close to the bed (bed levelling is off) or too close to the previously printed layer (warping),See [Nozzle to close to the bed] and/or [Warping].
Trying to print too cold,"Check the temperature range of the filament you’re printing. Increase your printing temperature gradually in 5°C increments within the range, staying around 10°C below the glass transition temperature (for rigid.ink, find GT temp in the downloadable datasheets in the settings tab on product pages)."
Trying to print too fast,"Printing too fast, if you haven’t adjusted other settings to allow for the extra speed, can cause issues such as not being able to feed the filament fast enough. Try reducing your speed in 10mm/s increments until it feeds correctly.
"
Idler Tension,"If your extruder is equipped with some form of idler tension adjustment, decrease the tension. Lacking that you might be able to modify the feeder in some other manner (for example shortening the idler spring or replacing it with a softer spring). Or try a different, harder filament type or brand."
Too many retractions,"If the problem is caused by too many retractions, use a slicer software that allows better control and reduce the amount of retractions occurring."
Inconsistent diameter,"If your filament diameter is not consistent, you’ll notice it in your prints. Sections that are too thin will produce under-extrusions or fail to get gripped and transported by the drive gear. Parts that are too thick will over-extrude or even get stuck somewhere along the filament path. High quality filament has a consistent diameter from beginning to the end of the spool."
Filament slipping,There could be a thin section on a spool with inconsistent diameter. Or maybe your extruder’s feeder idler pressure is not high enough or possibly the drive gears teeth are worn or gunked up.
Moisture absorbtion,"Filament will absorb moisture, Nylons and PVA especially, but it can also happen with ‘normal’ filament, even PLA, it just takes longer. Make sure you store your filament in sealed bags with freshly charged desiccant."
Stale filament,"Filament can go stale, especially after it absorbs moisture or was exposed to UV/sunlight for quite a while. Generally once exposed to the air, we suggest replacing filament over 6 months old. However, if stored correctly it can last much longer and if unopened and stored in a cool, dry space may last indefinitely."
Brittle filament,"Brittle filament, breaking or snapping may mean stale filament. There are also some of the more brittle formulas, especially for PLA or PMMA, which might snap when passing the drive gear or is bent for example in a Bowden tube at a higher angle.

A good test for the ‘freshness’ of PLA filament is to bend it to 90 degrees (at room temperature ~20°C) with your fingers. If it snaps, it is stale. Pull 10-15 meters off the reel and try again. You might be lucky - it may only be the top layers that have gone stale.
"
Prevent a clogged extruder,"Prevent any accumulation in your nozzle by doing pre-emptive maintenance (regularly cleaning).
Use a filament filter. This is a small tool that is used (often clipped on) before the filament feeds through the extruder to filter away anything that may be sitting on the filament (dust/dirt). They can be printed and files are available on websites like thingiverse.
Make sure never to exceed the recommended HotEnd temperature for whatever filament you’re trying to use. Cooked filament blocks nozzles. This includes staying around 10 °C below the glass transition temperature (rigid.ink GT temp available on downloadable datasheets in the settings tab on product pages).
Use particle filled filaments in nozzle with at least 0.5mm diameter or greater.
We recommend FLOSS, a high-performance cleaning filament, to make preventive maintenance easy. Extrude a bit of rigid.ink Floss on a regular basis, such as between material changes and the risk of clogs should be lessened drastically. Especially when switching from a high temp material to a low temp one, or when cleaning up after particle filled filaments."
Unblock a clogged nozzle,"You can try to dislodge the block in your nozzle with an acupuncture needle, hypodermic needle or an uncoated high-e guitar string. Once you got the clog dislodged, try cleaning filament (see FLOSS, a high-performance cleaning filament).
A highly effective yet brutal (if done improperly) way to clean a blockage are so call cold pulls or the “atomic method”. We’ve got an article on nozzle cleaning methods here.
Another equally brutal and somewhat dangerous way is to torch your nozzle with a blowtorch (after removing it from the printer first!). The idea is to heat and melt the blockage within the nozzle. This is NOT a method rigid.ink advise for safety reasons.
With ABS you could try to soak it in an acetone bath overnight. The acetone should dissolve the blockage but will only work with materials acetone soluble have been used (rigid.ink ABS, ASA, PMMA, HIPS and Polycarbonate).
You can do the same for PLA with a bath of ethyl acetate."
In the top layer / pillowing,"3D printer pillowing occurs when trying to print a solid layer over a coarse infill grid. Depending on your infill percentage and your layer height, it may take a lot of layers to fully close the top surface over infill to produce a nice, smooth surface. Figure at least 1mm of combined layers for your top layer as a rule of thumb. So, if you’re printing with a layer height of 0.2mm use at least 5 top layers to play it safe. Other ways to reduce 3D printing pillowing are:

Print colder or increase fan speeds. Better cooling improves bridging performance, and that’s basically what we’re doing when printing over infill.
Use a higher infill percentage. More infill means smaller gaps, which are easier to cover.
Another possible cause for gaps in your top layer is under-extrusion . See [Under-extrusion]."
Holes and gaps in floor corners,"These 3D printer errors happen where a horizontal surface meets an inclined one. The top layer(s) looks like the printer could not be bothered to print all the way to the edge. Its causes are similar in nature to pillowing, but it can be more annoying to nail the exact cause when everything else is looking great!

There are a lot of possible causes of this, here’s a list of problem and solutions:

Under-extrusion can cause holes and gaps. Increase the extrusion multiplier/feed rate, also see [Under-extrusion].
Not enough top layers - increase the top layers count so you are printing at least 1mm thick.
Printing too hot - print at a lower temperature so the plastic sets in position faster.
Printing too fast - slow down the print speed. This allows the extruded plastic to cool more before the next pass of the nozzle. If kept too warm, the layer will peel back from where it was printed.
Not enough cooling - if at all possible, increase cooling during the printing of these parts of the object. Always check this is suitable for the material you’re using with the manufacturer.
Too little infill - increasing the infill percentage will help. Also look at the minimum infill length in your slicer and reduce this to allow smaller runs of infill to be printed at the edges of an object instead of being ignored.
The infill outline overlap is too small - all slicers can set how much the infill overlaps the outlines/perimeters of the object being printed. This setting makes sure they go all the way to the edge and fuse together and so help support the layers above. Try increasing this and note the result (too much and you will likely see the infill pattern poking through the object’s visible walls and other such surfaces).
Not enough outlines/perimeters - these also have a support role to fill, so increase these if at all possible.
Too much retraction - causes there to be gaps in positions where retractions take place, so reduce this."
Between infill and outlines,"If this happens on your first layer, chances are your nozzle to bed distance is not set properly. Your nozzle is probably too far away from the bed. See chapter [First Layer Issues]. If it happens later in the print:

This could be a result of printing too fast, try printing slower.
It could be a sign of (temporary) under extrusion. See [ Under-extrusion].
Another possibility is wrong extrusion settings in your slicer. Check what was dialled in is correct for your printer and print.
Increase your extrusion multiplier Simplify3D.
Increase extrusion width.
Increase overlap settings."
Gaps between thin walls,"When trying to print thin walls that are not multiples of your nozzle width in thickness, there is a common problem with slicers leaving a gap inside walls, severely weakening the structural strength of your wall. It is rather straightforward issue: if you’re trying to print a wall that is 0.9mm thick with a 0.4mm nozzle, an average slicer might end up using 2 lines at 0.4mm each and leave a gap of 0.1mm, as it doesn’t know a way to close the remaining 0.1mm.

Therefore you should always strive to stick to a multiple of your nozzle width when designing thin walls to help alleviate the issue:

Thin wall options - A lot of slicers today have special thin wall options, make yourself familiar with them and see where they can take you.
Adjust line width - Adjust (not necessarily increase) line width or the amount of outlines to force your slicer to construct your wall differently.
You can try increasing your extrusion multiplier to close the gap by intentionally over-extruding.
You can also set a narrower nozzle diameter in your slicer settings than you actually have fitted. If used with care and balanced against the extrusion multiplier, this can overcome some situations that your favourite slicer cannot cope with."
Steam coming out of your nozzle,"If it’s too late and moisture has affected the filament, try drying the filament or replace the spool.

To prevent moisture store your filament dry, this is why we at rigid.ink provide special Mylar (metallic) resealable bags with each order. Maybe build a dry box for storage or even to keep the filament dry while printing sensitive materials like Nylons or PVA, with those materials, a few hours on an especially humid day is all it takes."
Smoke coming out of your nozzle,"First time you heat up this nozzle, do it slowly, but you might still see smoke. Keep your finger on the power switch (if the printer even has one) and be ready to shut it down if there is more than just production remnants burning."
